| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |               21             |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |              190             | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)    |              3990            |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                 399                 |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |          11970              | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |          2,5          |
